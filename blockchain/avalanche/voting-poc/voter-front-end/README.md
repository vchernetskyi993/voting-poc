# Voting App

Example of using web3js with TypeScript and Avalanche backend.

Requires at least Avalanche local network & Elections contract deployed.

But new Elections could be created only from admin app.
So, admin-backend & contracts-gateway are required for that.

Dev setup:
```shell
npm start
```
